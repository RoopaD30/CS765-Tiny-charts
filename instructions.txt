The project is written in Python 3.8 using the graph libraries which are present such as matplotlib.

Instrcutions to run :

  python3 -m venv 765-test
  source 765-test/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python hist-vis.py --infile titanic.csv --column "Fare" --width 1
  
Usage

Files:

data -- contains the csv files which are being visualized
hist-vis.py -- The main file which is run to produce the visualization.
requirements.txt -- Contains all the libraries which are necessary to run the project

Arguments to run:
infile -- The name of the csv file which is placed inside the data folder which is to be taken as input. Eg: wnba.csv
column -- The name of the column which is to be used for making the histogram. Eg: Height
width -- The width of the visualization that you want to make in inches Eg. 2 for 2"x2" visualization

** Since we are making square visualizations and evaluating their performance, we are taking height = width and not asking for any height parameter as input

Command to run :
python hist-vis.py --infile wnba.csv --column "Height" --width 2
